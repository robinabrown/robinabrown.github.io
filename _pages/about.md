I'm a PhD student at the Stanford Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME), advised by [Marco Pavone](https://web.stanford.edu/~pavone/). I received my B.S. from Caltech in 2018, where I double majored in [Mathematics](https://www.pma.caltech.edu/research-and-academics/mathematics/math-undergraduate-studies/undergraduate-math-program-description) and [Business, Economics, & Management](https://www.hss.caltech.edu/undergraduate-studies/bem), and minored in [Control & Dynamical Systems](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/ugrad/ugrad_cds_minor). I have completed research internships with the [USRA-NASA Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://riacs.usra.edu/quantum/qacademy) and the [Amazon Modeling & Optimization team](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/mop).
